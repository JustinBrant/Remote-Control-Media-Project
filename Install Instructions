Install Instructions

----------------------------------------------------------------
Clone working SD card

The quickest install method is cloning an SD card with a working install.
Note that the new SD card must have the same or greater amount of space available than on the original.

- Download Win32DiskImager onto a Windows machine
- Insert SD card, open Win32DiskImager, and enter a path and file name for the desired output image file
- Select the correct drive letter under "Device" on the right
- Click "Read"
- When finished, remove the original SD card and insert new one to clone to
- Clear and format the new SD card, ensuring all partitions are removed (except the primary)
- In Win32DiskImager, select the new drive's letter and the previously saved image file
- Click "Write"

----------------------------------------------------------------
Installing from scratch

- Install phidgets libraries for Linux: phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_Linux
- Also install phidgets python libraries: phidgets.com/docs/Language_-_Python
- Install wiringpi: wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
- In /home/pi/.config/autostart, create a file named MediaProject.desktop which contains the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Exec=lxterminal -e "sudo /home/pi/Desktop/MediaProject/MediaProject.py"
Type=Application

- Ensure that MediaProject.py has its permissions set so that anyone can execute it
- Restart the pi. The program should now automatically run on startup in a terminal window

----------------------------------------------------------------
Running the scripts (after installation is complete)

To manually run the project script, open an terminal and navigate to the project folder. Then run:
sudo python MediaProject.py

To run the button and remote config script:
sudo python RemoteCommandSetup.py

Do not manually edit the MediaProject_IR_Commands.py file unless you understand how the remote command setup script works!
